# ⚡ NextStopCharge – Smart Electric Bus Fleet Management System

**Type:** Hackathon Project – Centennial College Transportation Innovation Jam 2025  
**Role:** System Architect & Researcher  
**Team Size:** 5 members  
**Duration:** 3 days

---

## 🚍 Overview
**NextStopCharge** is an AI-driven fleet management solution designed to improve the reliability and efficiency of **electric bus operations**.  
The system predicts battery and powertrain health, optimizes charging schedules, and provides real-time fleet insights using a **digital twin** and **AI forecasting models**.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Electric bus fleets face **unpredictable battery/powertrain failures**, unreliable telemetry, and range fluctuations caused by weather and routes.  
This leads to **unplanned road calls**, **low availability**, and **high maintenance costs**.  
Fleets lack a **unified, real-time dashboard** to identify emerging faults before breakdowns.

---

## 🔧 Proposed Solution
A **data-driven digital twin** system powered by **AI forecasting** to:
- Detect early signs of component degradation  
- Predict range under changing conditions  
- Schedule proactive maintenance  
- Reduce downtime and increase depot readiness  

---

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions
As the **System Architect & Researcher**, I:
- Designed the **overall system architecture and AI layer diagram**  
- Conducted research on **battery analytics, digital twins, and predictive maintenance**  
- Planned project workflow and milestone timeline  
- Co-developed the final **presentation slides and project report**  
- Ensured integration between technical, research, and design teams
